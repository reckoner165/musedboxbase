### MusedBoxBase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NYUMusEdLab/musedboxbase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NYUMusEdLab/musedboxbase)

# Rationale
Building pre-built images is hard. The curent status quo is setting up the image on your device and then using `dd` to create the device image.

# Structure
All app files live in the `/srv` directory.

# TODO
- [ ] Wifi passthrough for debugging
- [ ] Simple REST API and front-end app to be able to toggle system settings. Settings include:
  - Wifi network Name
  - WAN Network Name
  - Enable/Disable passthrough
  - Enable/Disable services (DNS, DHCP etc.)

# Build process
### build.sh
1. Build directories are set up as below:
```
/srv/ ->
  - src/ # All sources are downloaded/cloned into this directory
  - img/ # The final image "rpi2-picake.img" lives in this directory
  - tmpmnt/ ->
    - boot # The boot partition of the image is mounted to this directory
    - root # The root partition of the image is mounted to this directory
```
1. The latest Arch Arm image for the RPi 2 is downloaded into `/srv/builddir/src/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz`.

1. The final disk image is allocated at `/srv/builddir/img/rpi2-picake.img`. (Note: The default size of 3G is specified in `build.sh`. This is an arbitrary size that is an artefact of piCake's original use-case.)

1. fdisk is used with a bash HEREDOC to partition the .img file into a 100MB root partition and a [size of image file - 100]MB root partition.
(Note: The empty lines in the bash HEREDOC passed to fdisk are INTENTIONAL as they pass a /newline to accept the FDISK default.)

1. A loop device is created (this is why the --privileged flag is required on the docker container) and pointed at the rpi2-picake.img file. We save the loopdevice in the $LOOPDEV bash variable.

1. `kpartx` is used to detect partitions from the loop device and create devices in `/dev/mapper`. `dmsetup` is then used to the prepare the devices for mounting. The --noudevsync tag is used because docker containers don't have access to udev.

1. We format and create the filesystems in `/dev/mapper` with FAT32 for the `boot` parttion and EXT4 for the `root` partition.

1. Then, we mount the `boot` partition at `/srv/buiddir/tmpmnt/boot` and the `root` partition at `/srv/buiddir/tmpmnt/root`.

1. We use `bsdtar` (to preserve permissions) to extract the contents of the downloaded arch image into `/srv/buiddir/tmpmnt/root`. Then,  we move the contents of `/srv/buiddir/tmpmnt/root/boot` to `/srv/buiddir/tmpmnt/boot` to ensure that the boot files are allocated properly.

1. We use `proot` to chroot into the image, passing in the boot and root partitions mounted in `/srv/builddir/tmpmnt` as parameters. `proot` is syntatic sugar as it mounts the dns configuration and the `/proc` and `/dev` directories among others. It also conveniently mounts the host fs at `/host-rootfs` in the chroot. However, it is also perfectly legit to rewrite this to use vanilla chroot.

1. We `source` the env file at `./src/config/env` in order to pass variables defined in the current Bash shell to the Bash shell invoked by `proot`. This is a bit of a hack, but I haven't found a better way so far. Then we `source`

### arch-build.sh
1. We define `$APPDIR` at the top of this file. By default it is `/srv/app`.

1. We run `pacman -Syu` to pull in a couple of base packages. Currently we pull in:
  - `crda, iw, wireless-regdb, wpa_supplicant` for Wifi
  - `vim, sudo, python2, wget, git, curl, ca-certificates-mozilla, db, dbus,  ncurses, openresolv, openssl, xfsprogs, unzip` for general utility, updating ssh and easy of use when SSH-ing into the Pi.
  - `bind` to provide the on-box DNS for the self-hosted Wifi hotspot.
  - `hostapd` to create the self-hosted wifi network
  - `dhcp` to provide dhcp address assignment on the self-hosted wifi network.

1. We install a custom-built kernel from `./src/kernel/linux-raspberrypi-4.1.15-1-armv7h.pkg.tar.xz`. This custom-build of the kernel includes a wifi patch that enables the rt2x00 wifi card to host multiple wifi networks i.e. to host a wifi network while being a client to another wifi network. This is NOT REQUIRED if you do not need virtual wifi capability. If you choose to comment this line out though, you MUST update the `hostapd` config files to point to the correct device.

1. We copy `./src/config`, `./src/deps` and `./src/scripts`.

1. If you have a public key defined in the `$PRIV_KEY` env variable, it will be inserted in `/root/.ssh/id_rsa` and `/home/alarm/.ssh/id_rsa`.

1. Now, we will execute the **executable** scripts in `./src/scripts/install.d` by `source`ing them into the current script. Currently, there are NO guarantees about the order in which the scripts are run.

1. Now, we copy the systemd init files to `/etc/systemd/system` and create an env config file in `/etc/systemd/system/picake.service.d`. We copy the `$APPDIR` variable into here to enable changing the APPDIR in one location only (at the top of `arch-build.sh`). The symbolic links duplicate what happens when `systemctl enable <service>` is run as systemd detects when it is in a chroot environment and does not run, thus `systemctl` does not work.

### clean.sh
1. We try to detach all devices listed by `dmsetup ls`. Currently this detaches **ALL** devices, not just the two used by the current build. This is because I have yet to figure out how to share the `$BOOTPART` and `$ROOTPART` variables to the `clean.sh` script. This is due to Drone's build process running each script in a new Bash shell.

1. The loop device is also removed using `losetup -d`.

### deploy.sh
1. We use `pigz` which is a version of gzip optimized to utilize multiple cores to gzip up the image.

1. The image is then deployed to the release directory, in this case `/host-release` which is mounted from `/srv/app/releases/picake`.
